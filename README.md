The objective of the game is to collect all chests on the given level and get to the door to the next level. Beware of devils and lava lakes. You can run, climb ladders, destroy brickworks by shooting them. Note that destroyed brickwork blocks are reconstructed in time. Devils cannot be killed. If a devil dies by falling to a lava lake, the new one appears on the top of the screen.

Hint: you can get rid of the devil by immuring it in a brickwork.
